# FeatureSelection
Implemented 3 ranking techniques: Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR), Corelation Coefficient (CC). Made different combinations of the above 3 to eliminate low ranked features and identify the prominent features and compare the performances of models trained with every combinationâ€™s selected features.
